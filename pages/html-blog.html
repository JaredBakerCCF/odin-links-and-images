            <li>Watch Kevin Powell’s HTML Paragraph and Headings Video</li>
            <li>Watch Kevin Powell’s HTML Bold and Italic Text Video</li>
            <li>To get some practice working with text in HTML, create a plain blog article page which uses different headings, uses paragraphs, and has some text in the paragraphs bolded and italicized. You can use Lorem Ipsum to generate dummy text, in place of real text as you build your sites. VS Code includes a shortcut to generate lorem ipsum for you. To trigger the shortcut, type lorem on the line where you want the dummy text, then press the Enter key, and voila, you have generated dummy text without a hitch.</li>
